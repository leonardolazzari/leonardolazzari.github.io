                                      <p class="tm-text">
                                        The first European to reach New Zealand was the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1642. Although his visit was very short,
                                        his compatriot cartographer baptized the land "Nieuw Zeeland", named after a region in Holland.

                                        The arrival of Captain James Cook in 1769 had a much more lasting effect and led to the colonization of New Zealand by Great Britain.
                                         The Maori called the newcomers pakeha, and the word is still used today to indicate New Zealanders of European ethnicity.

                                        The first colonists faced a terrible and unknown land. Having counted on a few kinds of import,
                                        they invented and manufactured what they needed. The determination, the spirit of independence and
                                        the creativity of these first pioneers contributed to the formation of what would become New Zealand's character.
                                        Some Maori and Pakeas traded, worked and lived in close contact with each other. But with the rise in the number of colonists,
                                        the Maori population began to claim military property and aggression, and to contract infectious diseases.
                                        The European colonists brought with them innovations such as the written word and Christianity,
                                        which had a profound impact on Maori society.

                                        New Zealand is the heart of Maori culture, proud Polynesian descendants.
                                        Maori culture is the most ancient of New Zealand.
                                        It is mostly an oral culture that was collect during the end of XIX century by European intellectual.
                                        Maori people were and are refined sculptors, that have transformed rudimentary objects,
                                        like stones, bones and shells in real sculptures, and that built a lot of warships.
                                        Maori community after a lot of legal encounters, has obtained the right to teach native
                                        language in schools.

                                        Mountains:
                                        The North Island Volcanic Plateau covers much of central North Island with volcanoes,
                                        lava plateaus, and crater lakes. The three highest volcanoes are Mount Ruapehu
                                        (which erupts about once every 50 years) , Mount Taranaki  and Mount Ngauruhoe.
                                        The South Island is much more mountainous than the North, but it shows less recent volcanic activity,
                                        and the highest Mountain is the “Mount Cook”

                                        River and Lakes:
                                        Many rivers can be found between the mountains, and even if they are often swift and unnavigable,
                                        they are still utilized for hydroelectric projects.
                                        New Zealand doesnt contain many lakes, the biggest being Lake Taupo,
                                        located near the centre of the North Island, which formed after a violent volcanic eruption many years ago.

                                        Fauna:
                                        In New Zealand before the arrival of humans, less than 900 years ago,
                                        the country was mostly free of mammals, and it was mostly occupied by either insects or birds,
                                        including lots of flightless bird like the “Kiwi” which has become a national symbol of New Zealand.
                                        When humans arrived on the island, they brought lots of different mammals, like dogs, rats, pigs,
                                        sheeps and cattle, which impacted seriously the fauna of the country,
                                        damaging the forest habitat and driving many species to extinction.
                                        <br>
                                        Flora:
                                        New Zealand thanks to its geographical isolation has developed lots of unique types of flora,
                                        however the human migration has led to the importation of many “exotic” european plants.
                                        Massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived, with around half the forest cover lost
                                        to fire after Polynesian settlement. Much of the remaining forest fell after European settlement,
                                        being logged or cleared to make room for farming.

                                        New Zealand cuisine is largely driven by local ingredients and seasonal variations.
                                        An island nation with a primarily agricultural economy, New Zealand yields
                                        produce from land and sea. Similar to the cuisine of Australia,
                                        the cuisine of New Zealand is a diverse British-based cuisine, with Mediterranean
                                        and Pacific Rim influences as the country becomes more cosmopolitan.

                                        Historical influences came from Maori culture. New American cuisine,
                                        Southeast Asian, East Asian, and South Asian culinary traditions have become
                                        popular since the 1970s.

                                        In New Zealand households, dinner is the main meal of the day, when families

                                        Restaurants and takeaways provide an increasing proportion of the diet.
